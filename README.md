# Javascript Objects, Prototypes and Classes @pluralsight course

by Jim Cooper

Dig deeply into creating with prototypes using inheritance including constructor functions and classes. Gain a deep understanding of what happens with prototypes behind-the-scenes when creating objects and working with inheritance.

### Topics
- 1. Creating Javascript Objects
- 2. Javascript Object Properties
- 3. Javascript Prototypes and interfaces
- 4. Javascript Classes
- Using Built-in Javascript Objects

## 1. Creating and Using Javascript Objects
- Objects Literals
- Constructor Functions
- Classes
- Object Equility
- Merging Properties
- Immutability

### Javascript Equality Operators
- == this should be must avoided
Not type-safe ("42" == 42)
- === this should be use in almost all cases
- Object.is() , is less commonly use, it is almost identical to === operators, but some small mathematical differences Object(person1, person2) pass 2 objects, return true if it determines that they are equal

## 2. Javascript Object Properties

## 3. Javascript Prototypes and interfaces

__A Function's Prototype__
A function prototype is the object __instance__ that will become the protype for all objects created using this function as a constructor

__An Object's Prototype__
An object's protype is the object __instance__ from which the object is inherited

## 4. Javascript Classes

## 5. Using Built-in Javascript Objects
- Math
- Date
- Regex
